The task for 'outlier' folder:
1. Data is given. You need to select a column from them that describes the necessary type of activity of the farm. Using the data to analyze one of the specified aspects of the activity. Remove outliers.
2. Make a random and typical ranked sample of the required indicator in the amount of 10% of the general population.
3. Compare the results of the samples with the indicators of general population. Calculate the standard errors and compare the estimated and actual level of values for the general population.
4. Determine the necessary sample size in a repeated and non-repeated version using data for each of the sample options.

The task for 'stratification' folder:
1. Combine data on Revenue for your  characteristic from Task #1 and also the Region.
2. Sort by revenue 10050. Clear of zeros.
3. Find the necessary revenue division intervals. Build a histogram to visualize the density of the location of the quantities.
4. Split data on 5-6 cohorts by Revenue. Give names to every strat.
5. Find means and variance for every strat and for population.
6. Calculate real mean.
7. Calculate the sample variance and find the Deff value.
8. Make a sample from the number of observations selected in Task 1 in proportion to the share of each layer in the general population and find new values of the mean and Deff.
9. To give a descriptive economic and geographical overview of the presented regions of Russia on the basis of the stratification made.

The task for 'autocorrelation' folder :
1. Identify and remove seasonality in time series data (production of fermented milk products (2019-2021)).
2. Compare data with and without seasonality.
3. Add to this model several features: wholesale dairy price, index of dairy production costs and dummy.
4. Make regression analysis.
5. Make prediction.
The work presents in both variants: python and excel.

The task for 'ConfidenceInterval' folder:
1. Generate 20 samples of size 10 and calculate confidence interval borders and check hypotheses.
2. Construct visualizations of confidence intervals as the sample size increases, estimating the proportion of coverage of the parameter by the interval. In addition, estimate and visualize also the average length of each interval as a function of sample size.
3. For all the criteria under study, estimate the probability of an error of the 1st kind and construct a confidence interval for them depending on the sample size.
4. Estimate the power of the criteria as a function of theta value and the sample size.

The task for 'PredictionInterval' folder:
1. Train linear model to predict the apartment price from all other parametrs.
2. Test hypotheses about the insignificance of features and build confidence intervals for model coef.
3. Determine the signs of the apartment you want for yourself in city and build a predictive range of its price.
4. Fix all parameters except for the area of the apartment and construct a confidence band for the price of the apartment. In other words, for each value of apartment area, construct a confidence interval for the mean value of apartment price. Similarly, construct a prediction tape.

The task for 'InequalityCoef' folder:
1. Build Lorenz curve and calculate Gini coef based on the data using two methods (inteval and point).
2. Calculate Palma rate and Herfindahl-Hirschman Index.
